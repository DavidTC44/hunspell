I am trying to discover whether anybody has devized a means of editing Hunspell dictionaries. In particular, it is used in Pegasus PMAIL, and over time spurious rubbish gets in to the dictionary, misspells and typos.
Also, Hunspell seems to have a problem with apostropies. I have specifically added items like " David's" many times, and yet it still trows it up as a mispell.
I am very keen to find solutions to both of these problems.
